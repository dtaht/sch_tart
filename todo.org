* DONE move bypass to tart_reconfigure
* DONE move stats to end of gso loop
* DONE correct ecn reporting
* TODO Should drop reporting and mark reporting be merged?
I don't think so, even though that's what fq_codel seems to do
* DONE always peel
* DONE remove sqrt cache
* DONE try different codel model
* DONE remove input rate estimator
* DONE remove #define CAKE_SET_WAYS (8)
* DONE run newton twice in reverse
* DONE reuse now in codel_dequeue
* DONE Fix bug with FQ (diffserv4 no workie)
Seem to have introduced a hashing problem when I ripped out
the set associative hash, we are always seing single queue
drop behavior now. FIXED: host_keys hash is not useful
for the 5 tuple. Not sure if it's useful for src or dst only
either
* TODO SQM mode
A three bin shaper exactly equal to the sqm-scripts
* TODO share codel_vars across all tins
calculate base target/interval instead of one derived from rate

target and interval are 32 bits but in ns?

        b->cparams.target = max(byte_target_ns, ns_target);
        b->cparams.interval = max(rtt_est_ns +
                                     b->cparams.target - ns_target,
                                     b->cparams.target * 8);

* TODO Review both ns2_codel and fq_codel codel implementations
* TODO figure out quantum calculation better
* TODO Is rate_overhead actually useful?
* TODO Improve overload protection
It is presently a memory limit only thing, should 
probably be an exessive delay thing delay > 4 * interval?
* DONE rip out useless statistics
My criteria for a statistic is - does it report on variable
needed by the algorithm? If not, there better be a good human
UI reason for it. 
At the moment, since quantum is autocalculated, I'd like that
as a statistic....
* TODO something I keep forgetting to do
* TODO remove packet limits
rely on memory usage only
* TODO custom_dequeue has some unneeded subtlties
? b->backlogs[q->current_flow???)]
* TODO remove lower target bound in favor of increased interval
or:
dynamically soften delay targets with lots of flows
	ns2_codel?
* TODO track memory by packet size

as an inbound shaper we will usually hav3 2k for acks

* TODO fq_codel bulk drop
yags

size the number of queues to the rate

6 and 60ms for target and interval

size the number of queues to the bandwidth 48 is 6ms target at 100mbit 32? 64? 3ms target?
